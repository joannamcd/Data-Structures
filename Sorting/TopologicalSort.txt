TOPOLOGICAL SORT:
-given a directed acyclic graph, a linear ordering of vertices such that
    for every directed edge (u,v) vertex u comes before v in the ordering
    (DAG: directed graph that does not contain any cycles)

(directions) A->B A->C B->D C->D D->E
        A 
      /   \
     B     C
     |    /
       D 
        \ 
          E 

Topological sort is not unique 
    A B C D E 
    A C B D E 

Applications:
- build systems (eclipse, sublime text) - top. sort to know which library should be picked first
- advanced-packaging tool (apt-get)
- task scheduling
- pre-requisite problems - courses 

Empty stack 
vertices - unvisited vs visited 

time complexity: 
O(V+E) 
V are vertices 
E are edges
