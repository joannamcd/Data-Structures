BREADTH FIRST SEARCH 

-VERTEX BASED 
to find the shortest path in the graph
-uses QUEUE, follows FIFO  

selects one vertex at a time when it is visited and marked 
then its adjacent are visited and stored in the queue.
Slower than DFS 

Input:
            A 
           /  \
          B    C 
         /    / \
        D    E   F

Output:
A, B, C, D, E, F 

For each node, first, the node is visited and then its child nodes are put in a FIFO queue.
Then the first node is popped out and then its child nodes are put in a FIFO queue 
    and repeat until the queue becomes empty

Main idea:
Traverse all the nodes of a lower level before moving to any of the nodes of a higher level
methods:
- naive: find height of the tree and traverse each level and printing the nodes of that level
- efficiently using a queue
