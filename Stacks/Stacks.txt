STACKS

Linear data structure following a particular order in which the operations are performed
Order may be LIFO(last in first out) or FILO(first in last out)
Basic Operations:
push() to insert an element into the stack 
pop() to remove an element from the stack
top() returns the top element of the stack
isEmpty() returns true if stack is empty else false
size() returns the size of the stack

push() O(1) 
pop() O(1)
isEmpty() O(1)
size() O(1)

Fixed size stack: has a fixed size and can't grow or shrink dynamically.
    If it's full and an attempt is made to add an element to it, an overflow error occurs.
    If it's empty and an attempt is made to remove an element from it, an underflow error occurs.

Dynamic size stack: can grow or shrink dynamically. 
    When full, it automatically increases its size to accommodate the new element. 
    When the stack is empty, it decreases its size. 
    This type is implemented using a linked list.
