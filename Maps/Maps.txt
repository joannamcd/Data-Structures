MAPS, DICTIONARY, HASH MAP, OR ASSOCIATIVE ARRAY

Stores a collection of key-value pairs, where each key is associated with a single value

HASH MAP
Uses a hash fn to map keys to indices in an array 
Takes key as input and produces index into the array where the value is stored.
Avg O(1) for operations such as insertion and retrieval

* MAPS
- keys are unique, values can be duplicated
- unordered collection
- dynamic size
- elements can be retrieved using their key
- used for operations like adding, removing, and accessing key-value pairs
- implemented using linked lists or trees
