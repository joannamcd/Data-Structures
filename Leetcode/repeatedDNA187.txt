The DNA sequence is composed of a series of nucleotides abbreviated as 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T'.

    For example, "ACGAATTCCG" is a DNA sequence.

When studying DNA, it is useful to identify repeated sequences within the DNA.

Given a string s that represents a DNA sequence, return all the 10-letter-long sequences (substrings) that occur more than once in a DNA molecule. You may return the answer in any order.


class Solution:
    def findRepeatedDnaSequences(self, s: str) -> List[str]:

        start = 0
        end = 9
        seen = {}
        answer = []

        while end < len(s):
            subStr = s[start:end+1]
            print(subStr)
            if subStr in seen and subStr not in answer:
                answer.append(subStr)
            else:
                seen[subStr] = 1
            start += 1
            end += 1
        return answer
