TREES

- Represent and organize data in a way that is easy to navigate and search 
- Collection of NODES that are connected by edges 
    and has a hierarchical relationship b/t the NODES
- Topmost NODE of the TREE is called the ROOT
- NODES below it are called the CHILD NODES. 
- Each NODE can have multiple CHILD NODES
- CHILD NODES can also have their own CHILD NODES
    forming a recursive structure
- NON-LINEAR data structure


Consists of a CENTRAL NODE, STRUCTURAL NODES, AND SUB-NODES 
    which are connected via edges
    "roots, branches, and leaves" connected with one another 

                 A 
              /     \
            B         C
          /   \     /   \
        D      E   G      F
       /        \        /
      H          I      J
     / \        / \    / \
    K   L      M   N  O   P

    A is the root 
    A-C is an edge

    B-D-E is a subtree
    where B is a parent, D and E are siblings, and child nodes of B 

    K, L, M, N, O, P are Leaf Nodes or External Nodes 

    A, B are ancestor nodes of the node E  

    A is at Level 0 
    B, C are at Level 1
    D, E, G, F are at Level 2
    H, I, J are at Level 3
    K, L, M, N, O, P are at Level 4

Representation of a Node in Tree Data Structure
    struct Node{
        int data;
        struct Node *first_child;
        struct Node *second_child;
        structu Node *third_child;
        .
        .
        .
        struct Node *nth_child;
    }

TYPES OF TREE DATA STRUCTURES:

BINARY TREE:
each node can have a maximum of two children linked to it. 
common types: full, complete, balanced, and degenerate or pathological

TERNARY TREE:
each node has at most 3 child nodes
usually distinguished as left, mid, and right

N-ARY TREE OR GENERIC TREE:
a collection of nodes where each node is a data structure,
that consists of records and a list of references to its children
duplicate references are NOT allowed. 
Unlike the linked list, each node stores the address of multiple nodes


BASIC OPERATION:
- Create - create a tree in the data structure
- Insert - inserts data in a tree
- Search - searches specific data in a tree to check whether it is present or not 
- Traversal:
    Preorder - performing traveling a tree in a pre-order manner
    In order - performing traveling a tree in a pre-order manner
    Post-order - performing traveling a tree in a pre-order manner

PROPERTIES:
- Number of edges: if a tree has N nodes than it will have N-1 edges. 
    Only one path from each node to any other node of the tree.
- Depth of a node: len of the path from the root to that node.
    each edge adds 1 unit of len. 
    So, it is num of edges in the path from root to node
- Height of a node: Len of the longest path from the node to a leaf node of the tree
- Height of the tree: len of the longest path from the root of the tree to a leaf node of the tree
- Degree of a node: total count of subtrees attached to that node.
    degree of a leaf node = 0
    degree of a TREE is the max degree of a node among all the nodes in the tree
